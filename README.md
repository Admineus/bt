# BITREVERSE - REVERSE MINING
Bitcoin, Altcoins and Ethereum address collision mining software.
Multi GPUs, full CUDA optimised.

The unique feature about this software is that each generated private key is tested against millions of Bitcoin, Altcoin or Ethereum addresses. Performances are 44'000'000 keys against 17'000'000 addresses (compressed/uncompressed and Ethereum) per second with a small GTX 1060 3GB (748'000'000'000'000 matching per seconds). Mining Rigs are Welcome !
